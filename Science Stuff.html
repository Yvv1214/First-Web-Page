                         <p>Glucose is stored as energy or used to make ATP immediatly as we take in O2. When we are not breathing or running out of O2 ATP production decreases therefor 
                         we start to lose consciousness. What is stored as glucose is used when we start exersicing or slowly througout the day.

                        <p>DNA is the blueprint of our bodies. The order of the genomes determines our characteristics: Phenotypes and Genotypes. Our DNA has something called telomeres 
                        and when it is damaged it causes "aging". That is becuase telomeres are like a coated cap end to our DNA. Without it our DNA starts to get frayed meaning that
                        our "blueprint" or our bodies "manual" starts getting missing "instructions" or functions. Our telomeres have a protective enzyme called the telomerase, kit counteracts 
                        the damage to telomeres. But as cells divide repeatedly, there seems to be less telomerase, therefor the damage to telomeres begin and biological aging beigns. 
                        There are ways to slow this process down with HIIT training, fruits high in antioxidants, sleep to detox our lymph nodes, and collagen rich foods. Telomerase can reverse 
                        the aging process, but it is a very complex issue becuase at one point of our lifes our bodies hit an off switch for telomerase and introducing the enzymes that encourage 
                        production of telomerase is linked to cancer. This becuase cancer cells are abnormal cells that use telomerase to maintain themselves while normal cells are programmed to
                        self destruct. We can't use cancer cells to replenish our telomerase because they destroy our healthy cells we need to live and they divide uncontrollably due to the absence
                        of P50 if I remember correctly.</p>

                    Nanotechnology is the science and engineering at the subatomic level, 1*10^-9. It is beyond the micro level, but bigger than angstrom which is about the width of an atom. <br>

                        Google X, semi secret laboratory, is working on nanobots for medical purposes. For more efficient diagnostics and targeted drug delivery. Nanobots are smaller than cells making 
                        drug delivery more precise. Nanobots would be biodegradable so it wouldn't disturb the bodies chemistry. Just like when we get implants, it has to be a material that does not 
                        oxidize or corrode in our bodies, or cause a chemical reaction that created a substance inside us that can be toxic. For example, the implants used in our bodies consist of certain types of ceramics, polymers,
                        and metals. All of which were picked carefully so that don't corrode inside. If we were to use iron for hip replacement instead of titanium, it will oxidize causing rust, which is iron bonding with the oxygen in 
                        our blood, and at the same time the bonds become weak and break apart in which at the macro level it considered as "bleeding". Then that bleeding rust is going to circulate our bodies. So when a nanobot 
                        dissolves it will dissolve as any other waste thats in our body and be naturally expelled. <br>
